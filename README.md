This project aims to study and analyze the performance of deep learning models under different experimental conditions, including Dropout ablation experiments, Transformer context length ablation experiments, and word/sub-word ablation experiments.

Through this code base, you can complete data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, result visualization, and on this basis, conduct comparative experiments of different designs. The project simultaneously provides log recording, training result saving and visualization tools.

Run the main.py file to evaluate the training and comparison of the three models;
Run dropout_ablation.py and word_subword_ablation.py. transformer_ctx_ablation.py is used to conduct Dropout ablation experiments, word/sub-word ablation experiments, and Transformer context length ablation experiments.
